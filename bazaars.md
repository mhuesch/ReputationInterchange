# Bazaars

Bazaars is a set of tools for commercial operations rooted in social fabric. Think of it as a _cross-membrane co-ordination protocol for monetary transactions in multiple Neighbourhoods_. These protocols are specifically suited to avoid common multi-exchange problems like double-spending and differential offers made based on the context. 

Bazaars heavily leverages Holo-REA/Value Flows protocols. 

What does the intersection of monetary and reputation currencies occur? In other words, can reputation be monetised, and how?

As suggested in this article by Arthur Brock, reputation currencies are orthogonal to monetary currencies. In other words, reputation can be monetised, but it's a function of the context. Each neighbourhood decides if a particular reputation score holds monetary benefits. Maybe it's access to capital in the form of credit limits. Maybe it's access to a membrane, which permits people to engage in commercial activities \(ride-sharing, couchsurfing etc.\). Maybe its a higher rank in searches and feeds that people gain content from. The list is endless. It could also have no monetary value at all, and simply serves as a sensemaking framework that other's may choose to rely on to engage with you.
