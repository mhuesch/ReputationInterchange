# Reputation Interchange

The Reputation Interchange represents a mechanism through which users can contextually port their reputation across applications. 

## 'The Stake'

A two step process between application and agent. 

1. Proposal: As the name suggests, app-creators can 'propose' a congruency between reputation data from another context, to their own context. For example, ride sharing App B may propose to import reputation data from ride sharing App A for the purpose of calculating reputation scores within App B.
2. Consent: If the agent consents to this proposal, App B will have _read access_ to the agent's reputation data generated within App A for a particular Reputation Score. 

_When an agent consents, they are in effect, placing at stake reputation from one app, into another app._

> #### This 'Stake' has implications. It effectively sets the context for an agent for the computation of a Reputation Score. What an agent places at stake impacts how reputation scores are computed when others view them. But it also impacts reputation score computations when an agent wishes to view others in the applications.

The mechanism for Reputation Score computation is covered in detail in the next section.

_In data-centric technologies, our experience of reputation was with scores recorded in monolithic ledgers through a universal consensus forced upon us. Agent-centric staking enables us to embrace a more relative, contextual record  of reputation, that we believe lets us meaningfully engage with it._

## Building Contextuality

The two step process described above between an app proposing, and an agent consenting holds the key to healthy linkages and network effects for reputation \(See Tenets of the Reputation Economy\)

#### 'The Right Price' in the Traditional Economy = 'Contextual Stake' in the Reputation Economy

Price dynamics play an important role in the traditional economy. Tension created between supply and demand forces ensure 'the right price' is established during a transaction. 

However, in the Reputation Economy, the tension that exists between an app creator who proposes a 'stake' and an agent who may or may not 'consent' ensures contextuality between stakes in the long term. If an app creators proposes to import seemingly unrelated data to calculate a reputation score, it is quite likely that an agent will decline the request since it would distort their engagement with other agents. Vice versa for well designed proposals
