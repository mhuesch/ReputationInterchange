# Why Reputation?

Reputation Currencies play an important role in distributed economics. 

**Reputation currencies,** as described by the Metacurrency project help bring to the tangible realm aspects of humans, or agents in a network. 

By using memetic bridges, we facilitate network effects for reputation currencies, thereby building a wealth system in the long run, that doesn't need an overarching consensus to operate. Think of it as distributed, agent-centric fabric that underpins interactions in distributed networks.
